T-mobile family plan monthly fee divider.

I am a family plan holder for t-mobile. Usually each individual makes his or her own monthly payment. However, sometimes the payment cannot go through successfully. After some testing, I figured out. Under same account, whenever a user makes payment with amount A, other users cannot make the same amount of payments before the transaction has been processed. The transaction takes two days to be processed. For 12 people is 12 days. So it is impossible for everyone to pay the same amount of money before ddl. 

This program starts from history total payment, and assigns a unique new payment amount for everyone. It guarantees after everyone pays similar amount of money after long run.
